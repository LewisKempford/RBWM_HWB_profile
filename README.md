# RBWM Health and Wellbeing profile

This Health and Wellbeing profile was created to support RBWM's Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2026 - 2036. This is a simple profile, mainly using publicly available data.

GitHub has mainly been used for version control. The project and code has been made public for others to recreate or use code for their own projects/ pieces of work. 

There is no support provided for getting this running for a different Local Authority. Always happy to collaborate, receive suggestions and answer some questions but direct support with getting the code running specifically for you is not possible.

Project can be forked for local use. Not accepting contributions for this project, though if you have discovered a major bug or mistake, please feel free to raise this as an issue.
